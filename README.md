# AndroidNoPrivacy
A sample app that demonstrates how to extract sensitive personal information silently. Not that it's some complicated trick, it's just enough to target older SDK and you can access whichever information you need, even texts of the short messages.

Install it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adguard.androidnoprivacy) or download [the apk](https://github.com/ameshkov/AndroidNoPrivacy/releases/download/1.0/noprivacy_1.0.apk) to see how it works.
